# Render Architecture

This document describes EWM's rendering architecture, focusing on state management, the redraw state machine, and VBlank synchronization.

## State Ownership

The compositor uses direct state ownership through the event loop's generic parameter. All handlers receive `&mut State` automatically, enabling compile-time borrow checking without runtime overhead.

### State Structure

```rust
pub struct State {
    pub backend: Backend,  // Backend enum (DRM or Headless)
    pub ewm: Ewm,         // Compositor state
}

pub enum Backend {
    Drm(DrmBackendState),
    Headless(HeadlessBackend),
}
```

The `Backend` enum dispatches to the active backend. Backend-specific operations (render, post-render, early-import) are methods on `Backend` that delegate to the inner variant. Backend-agnostic orchestration (redraw loop, state transitions, frame callbacks) lives on `Ewm`.

Note: The Wayland `Display` is owned by the event loop (via `Generic` source), not by `State`. This ensures the display outlives all handlers. Communication with Emacs happens via shared state (mutexes) and a pipe fd for events — no IPC socket needed.

### Event Loop Integration

```
                EVENT LOOP
                     |
                     v
    EventLoop::try_new() -> EventLoop<State>
                     |
                     v
    event_loop.run(None, &mut state, |state| {
        state.refresh_and_flush_clients()
    })
                     |
         +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
         |           |           |           |           |
         v           v           v           v           v
     Session      Input      DRM VBlank   UDev        Module
     Handler      Handler    Handler      Handler     Commands
     (pause/      (libinput) (frame       (hotplug)   (DRM init
      resume)                 pacing)                  channel)
```

All handlers receive `&mut State` automatically.

The `refresh_and_flush_clients()` callback runs after each event dispatch:

```rust
impl State {
    pub fn refresh_and_flush_clients(&mut self) {
        // 1. Check if stop was requested from Emacs module (ewm-stop)
        // 2. Process module commands and sync keyboard focus
        self.process_pending_commands();

        // 3. Process pending early buffer imports
        for surface in self.ewm.pending_early_imports.drain(..) {
            self.backend.early_import(&surface);
        }

        // 4. Render queued outputs, focused first. Between outputs, check for
        //    commands that arrived during render — process them and defer
        //    remaining redraws (picked up next VBlank cycle).
        let focused = self.ewm.get_focused_output();
        let mut rendered_focused = false;
        while let Some(output) = self.ewm.next_queued_redraw(focused.as_deref()) {
            let is_focused = focused.as_deref() == Some(output.name().as_str());
            if rendered_focused && !is_focused && self.process_pending_commands() {
                break;
            }
            self.ewm.redraw(&mut self.backend, &output);
            if is_focused { rendered_focused = true; }
        }

        // 5. Process IM relay events and send to Emacs
        self.process_im_events();

        // 6. Clean up dead windows from space
        self.ewm.cleanup_dead_windows();

        // 7. Flush Wayland clients
        if let Err(e) = self.ewm.display_handle.flush_clients() {
            warn!("Failed to flush Wayland clients: {e}");
        }
    }
}
```

The interleaving ensures input commands (e.g., `ImCommit`) are delivered within
one output render (~3-5ms) rather than waiting for all outputs to finish
(~10-20ms with screencasting).

This pattern avoids `Rc<RefCell<>>` wrapping, providing:
- No Rc clone overhead
- No runtime borrow checking (compile-time safety)
- Clear ownership and proper Drop ordering
- Direct mutable references to state
- Backend is never `None` — no Option unwrapping needed

## Per-Output Rendering

Render elements are collected per-output, not globally. Each output only receives elements that intersect with its geometry.

### OutputState

Each output has its own state stored in `Ewm::output_state: HashMap<Output, OutputState>`:

```rust
pub struct OutputState {
    pub redraw_state: RedrawState,
    pub frame_clock: frame_clock::FrameClock,
    pub unfinished_animations_remain: bool,
    pub vblank_tracker: VBlankFrameTracker,
    pub lock_surface: Option<LockSurface>,
    pub lock_render_state: LockRenderState,
    pub lock_color_buffer: SolidColorBuffer,
    pub frame_callback_sequence: u32,
}
```

Key fields:
- `redraw_state`: Tracks the output's position in the redraw state machine
- `frame_clock`: Tracks last presentation time and refresh interval, predicts next VBlank via `next_presentation_time()`
- `unfinished_animations_remain`: When true, VBlank and estimated VBlank handlers queue another redraw even if `redraw_needed` is false, keeping animations pumping without explicit `queue_redraw()` calls from animation code
- `frame_callback_sequence`: Monotonically increasing counter incremented each VBlank cycle, used to prevent sending duplicate frame callbacks within the same refresh cycle
- `lock_surface` / `lock_render_state` / `lock_color_buffer`: Session lock per-output state (see `focus-design.md`)

### Redraw State Machine

The `RedrawState` enum tracks each output's rendering state:

```rust
pub enum RedrawState {
    Idle,
    Queued,
    WaitingForVBlank { redraw_needed: bool },
    WaitingForEstimatedVBlank(RegistrationToken),
    WaitingForEstimatedVBlankAndQueued(RegistrationToken),
}
```

State transitions:

```
                    queue_redraw()
        Idle ─────────────────────────► Queued
         ▲                                 │
         │                                 │ render submitted to DRM
         │                                 ▼
         │                    WaitingForVBlank { redraw_needed: false }
         │                                 │
         │ VBlank received                 │ queue_redraw() while waiting
         │ (redraw_needed = false)         ▼
         │                    WaitingForVBlank { redraw_needed: true }
         │                                 │
         └─────────────────────────────────┘
                   VBlank received (redraw_needed = true)
                   transitions back to Queued
```

When a frame produces no damage:

```
    Queued ──────────────────────► WaitingForEstimatedVBlank(token)
           no damage, start timer              │
                                               │ queue_redraw()
                                               ▼
                              WaitingForEstimatedVBlankAndQueued(token)
                                               │
                                               │ timer fires
                                               ▼
                                            Queued
```

### Queue Redraw Methods

```rust
impl Ewm {
    /// Queue a redraw for all outputs
    pub fn queue_redraw_all(&mut self) {
        for state in self.output_state.values_mut() {
            state.redraw_state = mem::take(&mut state.redraw_state).queue_redraw();
        }
    }

    /// Queue a redraw for a specific output
    pub fn queue_redraw(&mut self, output: &Output) {
        if let Some(state) = self.output_state.get_mut(output) {
            state.redraw_state = mem::take(&mut state.redraw_state).queue_redraw();
        }
    }
}
```

The `queue_redraw()` method is idempotent — calling it multiple times won't queue duplicate redraws.

## Render Loop

The production render loop lives in `State::refresh_and_flush_clients()` (see
above) and uses `Ewm::next_queued_redraw()` to select the next output:

```rust
impl Ewm {
    fn next_queued_redraw(&self, prefer: Option<&str>) -> Option<Output> {
        // Returns the preferred (focused) output first if it needs a redraw,
        // then falls back to any other queued output.
    }
}
```

This prioritization ensures the focused output renders first, reducing input
latency for the active workspace. Between outputs, `process_pending_commands()`
drains any module commands that arrived during rendering. If commands were
found, remaining non-focused outputs are deferred to the next VBlank cycle.

`Ewm::redraw_queued_outputs()` is a simpler variant without interleaving,
used during DRM startup and in the test fixture:

### Render Flow

`Ewm::redraw()` orchestrates a single output redraw. The backend only handles the GPU/DRM render and returns a `RenderResult`:

```rust
pub enum RenderResult {
    Submitted,  // Frame submitted for presentation
    NoDamage,   // Render succeeded but no damage
    Skipped,    // Frame not rendered (error or paused)
}
```

Orchestration:

```
1. Get target_presentation_time from FrameClock
   └─► frame_clock.next_presentation_time()

2. Render via backend
   └─► backend.render(ewm, output, target_presentation_time) → RenderResult

3. Handle state transitions based on RenderResult
   ├─► Submitted: DRM backend transitions to WaitingForVBlank internally
   ├─► NoDamage: DRM backend queues estimated VBlank timer internally
   └─► Skipped: preserve existing timer or go Idle

4. Update lock render state if session is locked

5. Send frame callbacks to clients
   └─► send_frame_callbacks() — throttled by frame_callback_sequence

6. Process screencopy and screencast via backend
   └─► backend.post_render(ewm, output)
```

The DRM backend's `render()` method handles:
- Collecting render elements for the output
- `GbmDrmCompositor::render_frame()` with GPU sync
- Updating primary scanout output tracking
- Collecting presentation feedback for `wp_presentation_time`
- `queue_frame()` with feedback data, or queueing estimated VBlank timer on no-damage
- Incrementing `frame_callback_sequence`

## VBlank Synchronization

### FrameClock

Each output has a `FrameClock` that tracks presentation timing:

```rust
pub struct FrameClock {
    last_presentation_time: Option<Duration>,
    refresh_interval_ns: Option<NonZeroU64>,
}
```

- `new(refresh_interval)`: Constructor; refresh interval is set from DRM mode refresh rate at output creation
- `presented(time)`: Records the last VBlank presentation time
- `next_presentation_time()`: Predicts when the next VBlank will occur, used for both the render path (`target_presentation_time`) and estimated VBlank timer duration

### VBlankThrottle

Some buggy drivers deliver VBlank events too early (< 50% of the expected refresh interval). `VBlankThrottle` detects this and defers processing with a timer:

```rust
impl VBlankThrottle {
    pub fn throttle<F>(&mut self, ..., callback: F) -> bool
    // Returns true if throttled (caller should NOT proceed — deferred via timer)
    // Returns false if not throttled (caller should proceed normally)
}
```

Each DRM output surface has its own `VBlankThrottle`. The VBlank handler calls `throttle()` before processing — if the VBlank arrived too early, processing is deferred to a timer that fires at the expected time.

### Real VBlank

When a frame is successfully queued to DRM/KMS, the compositor waits for the actual VBlank interrupt. The VBlank handler extracts `DrmEventMetadata` (presentation time, sequence number) and delegates to `process_vblank()`:

```rust
fn process_vblank(&mut self, crtc, meta: DrmEventMetadata, ewm) {
    // 1. Extract presentation time from DRM metadata (fallback to monotonic clock)
    let presentation_time = match meta.time {
        DrmEventTime::Monotonic(time) if !time.is_zero() => time,
        _ => get_monotonic_time(),
    };

    // 2. Process frame_submitted() and send presentation feedback
    match surface.compositor.frame_submitted() {
        Ok(Some((feedback, _target))) => {
            feedback.presented(presentation_time, refresh, seq, flags);
        }
        ...
    }

    // 3. Record presentation time in FrameClock
    output_state.frame_clock.presented(presentation_time);

    // 4. Transition state and handle redraw_needed / animations
    let old_state = mem::replace(&mut output_state.redraw_state, Idle);
    let redraw_needed = match &old_state {
        WaitingForVBlank { redraw_needed } => *redraw_needed,
        _ => true, // force redraw to recover from unexpected state
    };

    if redraw_needed || output_state.unfinished_animations_remain {
        ewm.queue_redraw(&output);
    } else {
        ewm.send_frame_callbacks(&output);
    }
}
```

Presentation feedback flags include `Vsync | HwCompletion`, plus `HwClock` when the DRM timestamp is a real hardware timestamp (not zero).

### Estimated VBlank

When rendering produces no damage (content unchanged), the compositor uses a timer instead of submitting to KMS. The timer duration is computed from `FrameClock`:

```rust
fn queue_estimated_vblank_timer(&mut self, output, ewm, target_presentation_time) {
    let now = get_monotonic_time();
    let mut duration = target_presentation_time.saturating_sub(now);

    // Don't set a zero timer — frame callbacks are sent right after render anyway
    if duration.is_zero() {
        duration = frame_clock.refresh_interval().unwrap_or(Duration::from_micros(16_667));
    }

    let token = handle.insert_source(Timer::from_duration(duration), |_, _, state| {
        drm.on_estimated_vblank_timer(crtc, &mut state.ewm);
        TimeoutAction::Drop
    });
    output_state.redraw_state = WaitingForEstimatedVBlank(token);
}
```

The estimated VBlank handler increments `frame_callback_sequence` and either transitions to `Queued` (if a redraw was requested or animations remain) or to `Idle` (sending frame callbacks to clients).

## Frame Callback Throttling

Each output maintains a `frame_callback_sequence` counter that increments on every VBlank (real or estimated). The `send_frame_callbacks()` method uses this to avoid duplicate callbacks:

```rust
pub fn send_frame_callbacks(&self, output: &Output) {
    let sequence = self.output_state.get(output).map(|s| s.frame_callback_sequence);

    // For each surface: check if primary scanout output matches,
    // then check if already sent at this sequence number.
    // Skip if (last_output, last_sequence) matches current — prevents
    // double-sending within the same refresh cycle.
}
```

This is especially important because frame callbacks are sent from both the VBlank handler (for `redraw_needed: false`) and the render path (after every `redraw`).

## Damage Tracking

The `DrmCompositor` compares element commit counters between frames via `render_frame()`:

- **No damage** (`result.is_empty`): Skip frame submission, use estimated VBlank timer
- **Damage detected**: Submit frame to DRM via `queue_frame()`, wait for real VBlank

This optimization reduces CPU/GPU usage when content is static.

## Presentation Feedback

The `wp_presentation_time` protocol provides clients with accurate frame timing information:

1. Before `queue_frame()`, `take_presentation_feedbacks()` collects `OutputPresentationFeedback` from all visible surfaces (windows, layer surfaces, lock surfaces) using their render element states
2. The feedback and `target_presentation_time` are passed as frame data through `queue_frame()`
3. On VBlank, `frame_submitted()` returns the feedback, which is then sent to clients via `feedback.presented()` with the actual DRM presentation time, refresh rate, and hardware flags

## Screen Sharing Integration

Screen sharing (via PipeWire/xdg-desktop-portal) integrates with the render loop:

1. After the main DRM frame is submitted, active screen casts for the output are checked
2. Elements are lazily collected (shared across multiple casts on the same output)
3. Each cast calls `dequeue_buffer_and_render()` to render into a DMA-BUF PipeWire buffer
4. Frame rate limiting prevents excessive CPU usage (~30fps cap via `should_skip_frame`)
5. Damage tracking within the cast allows skipping unchanged frames
6. Orphaned casts (output disconnected) are detected and skipped

Screen sharing orchestration happens in `Backend::post_render()`, called by `Ewm::redraw()` after a successful render.

## Session Pause/Resume

VT switching triggers session pause/resume:

```
VT switch away → SessionEvent::PauseSession
    ├─► Suspend libinput
    ├─► Pause DRM device
    ├─► Cancel all estimated VBlank timers
    └─► Set all output states to Idle, set paused = true

VT switch back → SessionEvent::ActivateSession
    ├─► Resume libinput
    ├─► Activate DRM device (acquire DRM master)
    ├─► Reset DRM compositor state on all surfaces
    │     ├─► reset_state() — re-read hardware state
    │     └─► reset_buffers() — clear stale buffer references
    └─► Queue redraws for all outputs
```

The DRM compositor reset on resume is critical: without it, stale buffer references from before the pause can cause rendering artifacts.

The `render()` method checks `paused` and `drm.is_active()` before rendering, preventing attempts to submit frames while another session holds DRM master.

## Shutdown and Cleanup

The state ownership model ensures proper cleanup ordering:

```
Kill Combo / ewm-stop / Client Exit
    │
    ▼
ewm.stop() -> LoopSignal::stop()
    │
    ▼
event_loop.run() returns
    │
    ▼
State dropped (in order):
    ├─► Backend::Drm(DrmBackendState)::drop() runs
    │     ├─► Session notifier removed from event loop
    │     ├─► DRM devices dropped (DRM master released)
    │     └─► LibSeatSession dropped (VT released)
    └─► Ewm dropped (Wayland globals cleaned up)
    │
    ▼
Clean exit to TTY
```

### Session Notifier Cleanup

The `DrmBackendState` implements `Drop` to ensure the session notifier is removed
from the event loop BEFORE the `LibSeatSession` is dropped. This is critical because:

1. The `SessionNotifier` holds references to session internals
2. In embedded mode (dynamic module), the process doesn't exit to force cleanup
3. If the session drops while the notifier is still registered, libseat cleanup fails

```rust
impl Drop for DrmBackendState {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // Remove notifier BEFORE session drops
        if let (Some(handle), Some(token)) = (&self.loop_handle, self.session_notifier_token.take()) {
            handle.remove(token);
        }
        // Fields then drop in declaration order: device → libinput → session
    }
}
```

This ensures clean shutdown when running as a dynamic module within Emacs.

## Resolved Gaps vs Niri

Comparison performed against niri commit `ae14fa12`. All correctness gaps have
been resolved. Animations are excluded (not yet implemented).

### 1. DMA-BUF Feedback — RESOLVED

`SurfaceDmabufFeedback { render, scanout }` built per output surface at connect
time. `Ewm::send_dmabuf_feedbacks()` sends per-surface feedback after each render,
using `select_dmabuf_feedback` to choose scanout vs render feedback based on
primary scanout output tracking. Single-GPU simplification: `render = scanout.clone()`.

### 2. Lock Render State — RESOLVED

`Ewm::redraw()` now sets `lock_render_state` to `Locked` or `Unlocked` on every
non-Skipped render, matching niri's bidirectional pattern.

### 3. Cursor and DnD Frame Callbacks — N/A

EWM uses a static fallback cursor (`MemoryRenderBuffer`), not client cursor
surfaces. No DnD icon tracking implemented. Gap doesn't apply.

### 4. Screencopy Damage Tracking — RESOLVED

Per-queue `OutputDamageTracker` computes actual damage between frames.
`CopyWithDamage` requests skip rendering when no damage exists, staying in the
queue until the next redraw. `Copy` requests render immediately via
`Backend::with_renderer()` for low-latency screenshots. Both paths update the
damage tracker to keep subsequent `CopyWithDamage` calls accurate.

### 5. Fallback Frame Callback Timer — RESOLVED

1-second recurring timer sends frame callbacks to all surfaces (windows, layers,
lock surfaces) unconditionally, preventing stuck surfaces.

### 6. Session Resume Connector Re-scan — RESOLVED

`resume()` now calls `on_device_changed()` after DRM activate to detect monitors
added/removed during VT switch. Deferred output config and gamma restoration
deferred to when those features are needed.

### 7. Screencast in Compositor vs Backend — N/A (Structural Only)

EWM's `Backend::post_render()` pattern is functionally equivalent to niri's
compositor-level approach. Both produce identical results with per-output
rendering, lazy element collection, and frame rate limiting. No behavioral
change warranted.
